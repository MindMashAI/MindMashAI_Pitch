# MindMash.AI — Pitch Deck

This repository contains the official pitch deck for **MindMash.AI**, presented during the Solana Colosseum Hackathon and other Web3/AI events.

## 🧠 About MindMash.AI

MindMash.AI is a cyberpunk-inspired platform where users collaborate with multiple AI models (GPT-4, Grok, Gemini), earn tokenized rewards (Mash.BiT), and mint their creations—memories, music, thoughts—on-chain.

We're building on:
- **Solana** (fast, scalable layer for token + NFT economy)
- **Crossmint** (embedded wallet onboarding + minting)
- **Solflare** (native wallet for power users)
- **Next.js + Tailwind CSS** (for a responsive, neon-infused frontend)
- **Supabase + Python Flask** (for realtime data and token logic)
